declare String name;
declare double amount;
declare int tax_code;
declare double total;
declare double tax;

input "Customer's name: " + name;
input "Purchase amount: " + amount;
input "Tax code: " + tax_code;

//calculate total amount due 
int tax_code = 3
	switch(tax_code)
		case 0:
			tax = 0;
			break;
		case 1:
			tax = 0.03;
			break;
		case 2:
			tax = 0.05;
			break;
		case 3:
			tax = 0.07;
			break;
	total = amount + (amount * tax);

system.out.print(name, amount, tax, total);


2. Calculate Employee's Pay

declare long id;
declare double rate;
declare int hours;
declare double pay;

input "Employee id: " + id;
input "Hourly rate: " + rate;
input "Number of hours worked: " + hours;

//calculate weekly pay
if ((hours > 60) || ( rate > 25.00){
	system.out.print("Unable to calculate weekly pay);
	}
	elif (35 < hours < 60){
		pay = hours * (rate * 1.5);
		}
	else {
		pay = hours * rate;
			}
	
system.out.print("Employee id: " + id);
system.out.print("Hourly rate: " + rate);
system.out.print("Number of hours worked: " + hours);
system.out.print("Weekly pay is " + pay);
